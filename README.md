5.FLAMES GAME : 

Kids of age of 8 to 12 play this game. Its basically to put our crush names and do FLAMES(Friends,Love,Affection,Marriage,Enemy,Sibling). The logic to play this game is first cancel all the common characters from the both the names and then count the remaining ones. This count serves as iterating factor. Loop over FLAMES word with this count and cancel letters everytime the count ends. Take a look at the output.

9.Number Guessing Game using colours:

Basically its a number guessing game from 1 to 10, the trick involved in this is guessing the number using color as a hint. The closer you are to the correct number the warmer
the color is and far away from the number is indicated by blue shaded colors. So the correct number is indicated with red color and as you move away from the number it turns bluish.
